I use Facebook a lot to stay in touch with friends and family. I care about content, sharing photos, status updates and check-ins. They use Pinterest to pin, click and share the things they spend a lot of time with. A good start is the search for your favorite subjects.

On Pinterest (com), people upload pictures from their computers and pin things they find on the Internet using the Pinterest bookmarklet. Like most other social networks, Pinterest people perform standard functions in social networks, such as following friends, liking and commenting on other user forums, repining content from their own forums, sharing with other media (Facebook, Twitter, email, etc.), searching for and embedding individual pins from their websites and blogs

Find out how to use Pinterest for business. Pinterest is much more than just a social network. It is also a visual search engine and a productivity tool. Like other social networks, Pinterest is a place to connect with friends and influencers.

If you're a US-based brand that doesn't have a large audience, use Pinterest to store content and product ideas. Over 50% of Pinterest users live outside the US, which means you have the chance to reach a wider international audience with Pinterest.

Many users tend to limit themselves to what they use Pinterest for: wishlist, tutorials, gift ideas, or a combination of them all. With a few tweaks, you can get a lot more mileage out of your Pinterest boards. Using Pinterest in this way is not commonplace, but you will deserve the attention of all visitors who happen to check out your board.

The Pinterest functionality is very different from what you see on other social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Let's start with a quick overview of the various features and terminologies you need to know to take full advantage of Pinterest.

In this case, they are called Promoted Pins on Pinterest. Promoted pins are pins that companies pay to appear, and users are more likely to notice them. These are the pins that users see based on the interests and activities of the platform they visit, and not on the advertiser's website or app. Fun fact: Every second Pinterest user who made a purchase saw an advertised pin.

Give your board a descriptive name, so your followers know what kind of pins they will find on your board. Select this option to create a board similar to the other two options on the next page. If the category option is set to "All" on Pinterest, select "Close" to select other placeholders.

Let's say you like someone, but that's not enough to add them to your own boards. This is where the like button comes into play. To add a pin to your account, click "Repin" and follow the same steps as when adding a pin. Move the mouse over the image to Pinterest and three buttons appear: repin, like and comment.

Make sure you are using a high quality file. Test whether it works and make sure it matches the contents of the pins. Click Publish and select the board you want to add it to. You can crop, edit or add logos and text in the editor.

The next time you select Save Image, Pinterest gives you the option to either save the image on your current board or create a new board. Select Save this time to return to your home feed. Once you have selected Save, you will be prompted to create the board.

The more search terms you use, the more likely you are to find what you are looking for, and the less helpful terms appear when you search for something useful. You can place board sections for each room in your house. Click the plus sign on a Pinterest board when you see a snippet of articles.

It goes without saying that a pin with a description will bring more clicks to your site. Your goal is to get clicks by using descriptions to suggest more than just seeing your website. Don't just give Pinterest something to pique users "curiosity.

Searches on Pinterest are not always brand-related, meaning that users do not always include certain brand names in their searches. This means that you need to be extra careful to use the correct keywords in your pin titles and descriptions so that your brand appears in the search.
